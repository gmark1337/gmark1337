Welcome! 👋 I'm Gados László Márk!
I'm a passionate Backend Developer with a keen interest in building things that solve real-world problems and make daily life easier.
I’m currently a second year Bsc student at the University of Debrecen, studying in the Informatics Department.

🌱 What I'm Learning & Focused On
I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills! Currently, I'm diving deep into:

Node.js: I am currently working on a webscraper using the Puppeteer and node-fetch libraries to gather and process data from the web.

.NET / C#: I'm actively trying to sharpen my knowledge in C# and gain more hands-on experience in building robust and scalable backend systems.

🚀 My Projects
Feel free to browse some examples of my work. More projects will be added soon!

Project One: Web Scraper: A tool built with Node.js and Puppeteer to extract web data.

Project Two: Backend API: A RESTful API developed with .NET for a conceptual application.

Project Three (Concept): Future project idea involving real-time data processing.

🤝 Let's Connect!
I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or just having a chat. Feel free to reach out!
